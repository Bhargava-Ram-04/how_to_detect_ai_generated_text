While summer is meant as a break from the regular school routine, having some structured learning over the summer can help students maintain important skills and knowledge. When given the choice, I believe summer projects are best when student-designed rather than teacher-designed.

When students have autonomy in choosing their own summer project topics, they are more motivated to engage in meaningful learning. By allowing students to pick subjects they find genuinely interesting or relevant to their lives, they will be internally driven to explore the topic in depth. This type of intrinsic motivation leads to better focus and quality of work compared to assignments chosen by teachers without student input. 

Giving students ownership over project topics also fosters independence and skill development. By guiding their own work, students learn valuable skills like time management, decision making, and self-directed learning - skills that will serve them well in higher education and careers. Trying to complete a task completely of their own design also builds confidence facing open-ended challenges.

Of course, some guidance is still useful to ensure projects have educational merit. Teachers could provide general parameters like the type of final work (essay, presentation, etc.) or subject area but leave the specific focus up to students. This balance of student choice within guidelines maximizes engagement while maintaining academic standards.

In conclusion, when the goal is to sustain learning over summer break, student-designed projects are ideal. By letting students follow their interests with some guidance, they are intrinsically driven to dive deeply into self-directed work - an approach that serves their development far better than topics assigned externally. Autonomy, motivation and skill-building will better prepare students for future challenges compared to rigid, teacher-driven assignments over break.
