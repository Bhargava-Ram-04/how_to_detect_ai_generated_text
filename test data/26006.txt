Technology has become an integral part of our lives, and its impact on people's lives is significant. The advancements in technology have brought about many positive and negative changes in various aspects of our lives, including relationships, buying items online, and spending time with family.

On the positive side, technology has allowed people to connect with others from different parts of the world, making it easier for them to maintain relationships.
